# Welcome to ROML, the tool for studying vocab and conjugations

ROML is designed to be a free tool for students to use, as many diffent language learning sites are behind paywalls.

ROML uses text files created by the user to quiz conjugations and vocab. The formatting of these text files is different depending on if you're studying conjugations or vocab.

The text files for the vocab section should be organized as follows:

"vocab.txt"<br />
apple:manzana<br />
cat:gato<br />
grapes:uvas<br />
blanket:manta<br />

The title of the file is irrelevant. Switching the order of the languages in the file determines how you will be quizzed (Ex. english --> spanish vs. spanish --> english).

The text files for the conjugation section should be organized as follows:

"conj.txt"<br />
trabajar:trabajo:trabajas:trabaja:trabajamos:trabajáis:trabajan<br />
comer:como:comes:come:comemos:coméis:comen<br />
andar:ando:andas:anda:andamos:andáis:andan<br />
ser:soy:eres:es:somos:sois:son<br />
bailar:bailo:bailas:baila:bailamos:bailáis:bailan<br />

It should be noted that only one tense can be studied at a time. For example, in the text file above, all of the conjugations are in the present indicative tense of spanish.

# How to run

Right now, ROML can only be run in the terminal by downloading it and typing<br />
python Language.py<br />
into the terminal. In the future, I hope to add a user interface that makes using ROML more convieniant
