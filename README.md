# Welcome to ROML, the tool for studying vocab and conjugations

ROML is designed to be a free tool for students to use, as many diffent language learning sites are behind paywalls.

ROML uses text files created by the user to quiz conjugations and vocab. The formatting of these text files is diffenernt depending on if you're studying conjugations or vocab.

The text files for the vocab section should be organized as follows:

"vocab.txt"<br />
apple:manzana<br />
cat:gato<br />
grapes:uvas<br />
blanket:manta<br />

The title of the file is irrelevant. Switching the order of the languages in the file determines how you will be quizzed (Ex. english --> spanish vs. spanish --> english).

The text files for the conjugation section should be organized as follows:

"conj.txt"<br />
trabajar:trabajo:trabajas:trabaja:trabajamos:trabajáis:trabajan<br />
comer:como:comes:come:comemos:coméis:comen<br />
andar:ando:andas:anda:andamos:andáis:andan<br />
ser:soy:eres:es:somos:sois:son<br />
bailar:bailo:bailas:baila:bailamos:bailáis:bailan<br />

It should be noted that only one tense can be studied at a time. For example, in the text file abouve, all of the conjugations are in the present indicative tense of spanish.
